Tips of the interivew:
 
Technical Questions:
 
For the technical questions, they will focus on your technical breadth & depth of knowledge, problem solving, and coding.
Depth: They’ll want details about methods you’ve used in your projects and why, details about projects to see if they were creative and pragmatic, details about whether you’ve dived deep to check outliers/edge cases, details about how you evaluated your models, and details about the fundamentals in your field of expertise.
Breadth: They’ll want to know in detail about other techniques and methodologies you’ve used that are outside your area of expertise. 
Application/Problem Solving: The interviewer will ask an ambiguous problem solving question (case study). They’ll want to assess if you can productively discuss a problem which is slightly underspecified. They’ll want to see that you know to ask clarification questions, reason about the missing pieces of information, and progress towards a solution or model to the problem.

Coding: For Applied Scientists, they’ll assess your ability to meet SDE Junior level coding write code in any language of your choice, your ability to think algorithmically, analyze algorithm performance (runtime + space complexity and tradeoffs.), know general data structures (e.g., trees, graphs), take hints and discuss code with a SDE. Coding at the level of being able to manipulate data understanding basic data structures (e.g., Hashes, Lists, Arrays), Standard general algorithms (e.g., searching, sorting). If you can write the code in one production language (Python, Java, C++, etc.) and broad knowledge of coding methods (e.g., recursion)
Videos: In this section you’ll find videos of Amazonians describing the coding questions and ideal solutions/approaches in our on-site interviews.

Tips for the Technical Questions:
 
- MOST IMPORTANT: The interviewer wants to see that you can properly gather the right requirements and can break down the problem. They will ask these questions in a very vague or ambiguous way. Never make assumptions. You’ll want to make sure to ask good clarifying questions before you start to work on the technical questions that are asked.
- ALWAYS try to think out loud as you solve the problem. This helps the interviewer understand your thought process. It’s also helpful in the case you steer away from the solution, they will give you hints to get back on track.
- ALWAYS stop and check your work every few minutes.
- Keep in mind that a problem can often be filed in several ways. Interviewers are often looking for whether the candidate chooses the simplest solution versus the complicated one. Choose the simplest one! But also, talk to the interviewer about the various possible solutions and why you chose the one you choose.

Amazon 官方tips 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjZpZ_wcYFg

1. CS 基础，data structure and algorithms
2. 启发式的解决问题，而不是random的解决
3. clean, logical maintainable code and people is easy to understand 

key principle 
1. 在没有看space之前，直接jump into的problem 立即 - 需要分析space？
2. try and disambiguate the problem 使问题具体化，通过问问题，理解input and output， 有哪些edge cases 我们可以考虑
3. talk this out loud, interacte not recitation 通过讲述，让别人理解what you are thinking and why and how you are trying to solve this problem


```example
1. 要写注释
2. implementation
3. testing  - edge cases， then optimization 考虑time， and space complexity 
4. 优化的空间

```
