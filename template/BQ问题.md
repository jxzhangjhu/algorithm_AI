- S/T: 他们不来meeting，比较缓慢，积极性不高
- A: 首先沟通了解困难和问题，发现他们是时间还有credit，他们想从应用方面体现，时间上和manager沟通调整我们的timeline，然后credit，我们从AI和计算方面证明，他们从manufacturing证明

## 4. Challenge 挑战 [Customer obsession] 最重要的

### Most challenging project [highest standards, think big]
> 如何走出comfort zone，如何提升自己

- Story: inverse design problem 用normalizing flows这个
- S/T: why challenging 因为data比较少，DFT计算很贵，需要理解目标，之前都是forward problem，现在是inverse problem，如何利用AI ML去解决，这个方面的很少，我也缺乏这方面的经验

- Stroy: 对于材料设计的生成模型，和victor的分析，他觉得用VAEorGAN 更容易implement，但是效果不是很理想，但我坚持用flow-based model，因为能产生probabilistic information,这很重要尽管implement很难，没有人做，需要更长的时间，但值得去做，最后结果不错！
- S/T: model selection的分歧，我不同意，存在时间，implement成本，performance的trade off
- A: 我坚持追求高的标准，尽管时间可能要长一些，可能会错过一些deadline，但效果更好， 用到了并行的training 之类之类的

or tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities？

> 问题一定要让面试官信服你的例子，先说一般的方法很耗时，很难，自己找到一个方法很快就完成并且delever了，而且很稳定，没有过问题，结果要是好的

- Story: intelligence prior in high dimensional optimization + INN的这个例子
- S/T: 传统的优化容易掉入local minia，而且高维有问题，难度大，这个困扰了我们很久，很多问题需要optimization
- A: 我想到了一个好的方法，如果可以优化prior information找到一个好的初始解就容易很多，于是提出来invertible neural network的方法来帮助寻找最优解

<!-- Qiao Li Tips
```
Non-Technical Questions:
 
The interviewer will ask you 2-3 Non-Technical questions that are behavioral or situational questions.
The questions are based on our 14 Leadership Principles
A few sample questions may sound like:
Tell me about a time in which you disagreed with a coworker.
Tell me about your most challenging project.
Tell me about a time in which you worked under a tight deadline.
 
Tips for the Non-Technical Questions:
 
·            Understand the STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and frame your answers in that way.
·            Go through and understand our 14 Leadership Principles. Think of a couple solid examples that would relate to them, then verbally practice this story so it’s easy to tell in the interview.
·            While telling your story, make sure you are able to explain the importance of your projects, methodologies/techniques you’ve used, and its impact to the business. They will want to know why you took the actions that you did.
·            Amazon is data driven! Make sure your stories include data points, success metrics, etc.
·            Make sure to use “I” versus “WE” as you tell your story. The interviewer wants to learn about how YOU contributed versus your team as a whole.
·            Think of at least 3-4 examples of when you excelled in your role, and maybe 1-2 examples of when you’ve failed. Failure is never easy to talk about, but interviewers want to see how you recovered from the situation or what you’ve learned from that experience to grow.
·            Try to avoid using the same example multiple times if possible. You’ll want to try to use different examples with each of the interviewers, but feel free to share an example you’ve already discussed if needed.
·            Practice behavioral questions, similar to the ones found in this article: https://www.thebalance.com/behavioral-job-interview-questions-2059620

# Leadership principles 

### Customer Obsession 顾客至上， 全心全意为顾客服务
>Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

### Ownership 主人翁精神，不只顾着自己的一亩三分地，长期利益履行分外的职责，可以牺牲短期利益而实现长期目标
>Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."

### Invent and Simplify 创新简化，多research借鉴别人的方法来提高效率
>Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

### Are Right, A Lot 大多数是正确的决策，努力证明自己正确，说服别人
>Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

### Learn and Be Curious 学习工作外的事情，积极学习
>Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

### Hire and Develop the Best 招人和晋升
>Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

### Insist on the Highest Standards 坚持高标准，不妥协自己的高要求
>Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

### Think Big 远见卓识
>Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

### Bias for Action 崇尚行动，速度很重要，数据不足的时候，权衡利弊，想好backup plan，敢于冒险
>Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 

### Frugality 勤俭节约
>Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

### Earn Trust 不骄傲自满，要自我批判，敢于承认错误，赢得信任
>Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

### Dive Deep 刨根问底，有能力troubleshoot 到根本问题，解决根本问题
>Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

### Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit 不趋附大众，敢于提出自己的意见
>Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

### Deliver Results 达成业绩，排除万难，最后完成任务，或者最终从失败中学到了什么
>Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

### Strive to be Earth's Best Employer 新的准则，创造更好的环境
>Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

### Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility 新的准则，世界更美好？
>We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.
